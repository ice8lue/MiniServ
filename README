MiniServ by Frank Adler
=======================

MiniServ is a tiny little HTTP server written in Python 3.
There currently are two versions.

The old branch is a little outdated, works without threads.
The current branch uses threads and all in all works more efficiently (but at the moment has some timing problems).

To build/use it, you will need Python 3 together with WConio.
